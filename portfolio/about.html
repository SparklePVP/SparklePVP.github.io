      <h6>Core Competencies</h6>
	  <p id="p1"><h9>Communication ★4</h9><br>
I communicated by presenting and explaining the ideas of my game. I also got ideas from fellow <br>classmates on how to improve the game and fix up any errors they come across from my <br>scratch game. I also communicated ideas to classmates that needed help for stuck on what <br>to do. On my website I communicate my ideas through my work on my website and pictures.<br>
<h9>Creative Thinking ★4</h9><br>
I came up with a concept for a game idea and implemented that into my game. I visualised and <br>developed what my game would look like and the colors that will be in my game to help <br>create levels that are challenging and still stick with the theme of the game.  Another thing <br>is my website needed a theme that would make my website look good and was not filled <br>with random colors that wouldn’t make sense so I went through many different color pallets <br>before I made up my mind and went with a midnight, dark theme for my website.<br>
<h9>Critical Thinking ★4</h9><br>
I got the visual aspect of my game but it needed back end coding. So I had to come up with <br>some code that would make my game run. I created a code that had physics and <br>mechanics that would work with my game and I made it so that when I add something the <br>game would not break and glitch out. I had to work with new code that I wasn’t familiar with <br>to create a slideshow for my website to display my work and make it look aesthetically <br>pleasing to look at and easy to use.<br>
<h9>Personal awareness and Social Responsibility ★4</h9><br>
Tye and I worked well as a team for the computer presentation. We split up the work to make it <br>easier for use to do. I would do the information and the image gathering and Tye would <br>make the slides and change it up to make the slides look nice and not filled with <br>information. I am here every day and ready to do work and finish task on time. When I run <br>into a problem when making my game I would always analyze all the code then look for<br> what the cause was and what is conflicting with the code. For my website I would run into a <br>problem with presenting information and I would ask for ideas on how to present the information.<br>
