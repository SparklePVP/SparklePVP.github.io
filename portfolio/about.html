      <h6>Story</h6>
	  <p id="p1"><h9>Laziness won’t get you anywhere</h9><br>
<br>“In ancient times, a king had his men place a boulder on a <br>roadway. He then hid in the bushes, and watched to see if<br>anyone would move the boulder out of the way. Some of the <br>king’s wealthiest merchants and courtiers passed by and<br>simply walked around it.<br>
<br>
Many people blamed the King for not keeping the roads clear, <br>but none of them did anything about getting the stone <br>removed.<br>
<br>
One day, a peasant came along carrying vegetables. Upon <br>approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden <br>and tried to push the stone out of the way. After much pushing <br>and straining, he finally managed. <br>
<br>
After the peasant went back to pick up his vegetables, he<br>noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. <br>The purse contained many gold coins and note from the King<br>explain that the gold was for the person who removed the <br>boulder from the road.”<br>
